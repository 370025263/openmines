## Description
OpenMines is a Python-based simulation environment designed for truck dispatching in mining operations. It provides a flexible and extensible framework to model and simulate various mining scenarios from a complex-system perspective with probabilistic user-defined events, enabling researchers and practitioners to evaluate and compare different dispatching algorithms.

Visualization is supported:

## Installation
OpenMines is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:
```shell
pip install openmines
```

## Usage

### 1. Create a Mine Configuration
First, you need to configure the mine by creating a JSON file. OpenMines provides example configuration files in the openmines/src/conf/ folder.

Example: `north_pit_mine.json` (Configuration for the North Pit Mine in Holingol, Inner Mongolia, China, with anonymized data)
```python
{
  "mine": {
    "name": "NorthPitMine"
  },
  "dispatcher": {
    "type": ["NaiveDispatcher", "RandomDispatcher", "NearestDispatcher", "FixedGroupDispatcher", "SPTFDispatcher", "SQDispatcher"]
  },
  "charging_site": {
    "name": "NorthPitMineChargingSite",
    "position": [0, 0],
    "trucks": [
      {"type": "OfficalTruck", "count": 9, "capacity": 77, "speed": 25},
      {"type": "CLTruck", "count": 29, "capacity": 35, "speed": 25},
      {"type": "XHTruck", "count": 33, "capacity": 55, "speed": 25}
    ]
  },
  ...
}
```

### 2. Create a Dispatch Algorithm
You can configure the dispatch algorithm in the `algo` folder (`openmines/src/dispatch_algorithms/`).  
The class should inherit from `BaseDispatcher` and implement the following methods:  
`give_init_order`, `give_haul_order`, `give_back_order` and the property `name`.

For example, the following code is a naive dispatch algorithm that always gives the first load site to the truck.
```python
## openmines/src/dispatch_algorithms/naive_dispatch.py
from __future__ import annotations
from openmines.src.dispatcher import BaseDispatcher

class NaiveDispatcher(BaseDispatcher):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = "NaiveDispatcher"

    def give_init_order(self, truck: "Truck", mine: "Mine") -> int:
        return 0

    def give_haul_order(self, truck: "Truck", mine: "Mine") -> int:
        return 0

    def give_back_order(self, truck: "Truck", mine: "Mine") -> int:
        return 0
```

### 3. Run the Simulation
You can run the simulation with the following command:
```shell
openmines -f <config_file>
# or
openmines run -f <config_file>
```
After the simulation, you can find the simulation ticks in the `$CWD/result` folder.  
The result folder will contain the following files:
- **MINE:{mine_name}_ALGO:{algo_name}_TIME:{sim_time}.json**: the mine information [the ticks]  
- {mine_name}_table.tiff [a performance table of the algorithms configured in your config]  
- {mine_name}.tiff [a production curve of the algorithms over time]  
![curve](./imgs/north_pit_mine.png)  
![table](./imgs/north_pit_mine_table.png)

### 4. Visualize the Result
You can visualize the result with the following command:
```shell
openmines -v <result_tike_file>.json
# or 
openmines visualize -f <result_tike_file>.json
```
The result will be a gif file in the `$CWD/result` folder.

### 5. How to Write a New Dispatch Algorithm

To write a new dispatch algorithm, you need to inherit from the `BaseDispatcher` class and implement the following three core methods:
```python
## openmines/src/dispatch_algorithms/naive_dispatch.py
from __future__ import annotations
from openmines.src.dispatcher import BaseDispatcher

class NaiveDispatcher(BaseDispatcher):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = "NaiveDispatcher"

    def give_init_order(self, truck: "Truck", mine: "Mine") -> int:
        return 0

    def give_haul_order(self, truck: "Truck", mine: "Mine") -> int:
        return 0

    def give_back_order(self, truck: "Truck", mine: "Mine") -> int:
        return 0
```

## 7. More Command Line Usage

In addition to the "run/visualize" commands mentioned earlier, `openmines` also supports the following commands to meet more advanced functional needs in research or experimental environments.

### 7.1 Fleet Scale Ablation Experiment for Single Scene
Test the production effect of the algorithm by varying truck scales in the same scene (configuration file):
```shell
openmines scene_based_fleet_ablation -f <config_file> -m <min_truck> -M <max_truck>
```
Example:
```shell
openmines scene_based_fleet_ablation -f my_mine_config.json -m 10 -M 50
```
This command will sample multiple truck scale points in the `[min_truck, max_truck]` range, run all the dispatch algorithms declared in your configuration, and output production comparisons or generate relevant charts.

### 7.2 Multi-Scene & Dual Algorithm Ablation Experiment
Compare the performance ratio of a target algorithm with the baseline algorithm across multiple scenes:
```shell
openmines algo_based_fleet_ablation -d <config_dir> -b <baseline_algo> -t <target_algo> -m <min_truck> -M <max_truck>
```
Example:
```shell
openmines algo_based_fleet_ablation -d configs/ -b NaiveDispatcher -t MySmartDispatcher -m 10 -M 100
```
This command will iterate through all the `.json` configuration files in the `configs/` folder, run the `baseline_algo` and `target_algo` with various fleet sizes (from `-m` to `-M`), and output comparison results or generate charts.

### 7.3 Log Analysis Commands
Analyze log files or directories, extract and generate summary reports:
```shell
openmines -a <log_path> 
# or
openmines analyze <log_path> [-d <dispatcher_name>]
```
Example:
```shell
# Analyze a specified log file
openmines -a /path/to/simulation.log

# Analyze the latest log file in the specified directory and specify the dispatcher name to query
openmines analyze /path/to/log/folder -d NaiveDispatcher
```
These commands will automatically identify the log content, extract and analyze key dispatch-related data, and output the generated report to the current working directory.

## 8. Reinforcement Learning Support

Reninforcement learning is a promising approach to achieve better performace on both flexibility and more.

Openmines managed to itegrate the truck-dispatching problem with the gymnasium standard.

```python

import gymnasium as gym

# Create environment
env = gym.make('mine/Mine-v1-dense', config_file="./conf/north_pit_mine.json")  # or mine/Mine-v1-sparse

# Reset environment
obs, info = env.reset()

# Run an episode
for _ in range(1000):
    # Execute using suggested action
    obs, reward, done, truncated, info = \
       env.step(info["sug_action"])
    
    if done or truncated:
        break

env.close()

```
